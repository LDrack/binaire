# binaire

Binary SRAM PUF analysis tool.

I developed this tool in the course of my master thesis at FH Hagenberg. Basically, it is a C# CLI receiving SRAM PUF data from a microcontroller board (in my case, a Nucleo STM32F401RE). Binaire handles COM port communication with the device over a simple protocol. Also, it handles communication with the database, storing the SRAM PUF data remotely.

For the STM32 source code, see https://github.com/LDrack/stm32-srampuf
